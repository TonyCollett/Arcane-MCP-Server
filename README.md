> **Note:** This is an independent, community-built project. It is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or maintained by** the [Arcane](https://github.com/getarcaneapp/arcane) project or its maintainers. We build on top of Arcane's public API.

> **Coming from Portainer?** Check out [Portainer-Offload-Arcane](https://github.com/RandomSynergy17/Portainer-Offload-Arcane) — a guided migration wizard that moves your stacks, containers, volumes, registries, and users from Portainer CE/EE into Arcane. Run it once, then come back here to manage everything via natural language.

## What is this?

Arcane MCP Server is a complete AI-powered Docker management bundle — an **MCP server**, a **Claude Code plugin**, and a **companion skill**, all in one package.

- The **MCP server** gives your AI assistant 180 tools to control your [Arcane](https://github.com/getarcaneapp/arcane) Docker platform — containers, images, stacks, Swarm clusters, security scans, and more. Filter that set down to a preset ([see Tool Filtering](#tool-filtering)) if all 180 is more than your context window can spare.
- The **plugin** wraps everything into a single install with guided configuration — no manual env vars or config files.
- The **companion skill** teaches your AI *how* to use those tools — safe deployment workflows, troubleshooting patterns, and guardrails so it doesn't accidentally nuke your volumes.

Instead of clicking through dashboards and running CLI commands, you just *talk* to your infrastructure:

> "What's running on production?"
>
> "Deploy this compose file to staging."
>
> "Are any images vulnerable? Show me the critical ones."
>
> "Scale the API service to 5 replicas."

Behind the scenes, the server translates your requests into the right API calls — with safety checks, retry logic, and formatted responses that actually make sense.

---

## Why use it?

| | Without | With Arcane MCP Server |
|---|---|---|
| **Check container status** | Open dashboard, navigate to environment, filter, scroll | *"What's broken?"* |
| **Deploy a stack** | Write compose, scp to server, ssh, docker compose up | *"Deploy this compose file"* |
| **Find vulnerabilities** | Configure Trivy, run scan, parse JSON output | *"Run a security audit"* |
| **Update containers** | Check each image, pull, recreate, verify | *"Update everything"* (dry-run first, obviously) |
| **Clean up disk space** | Prune images, volumes, networks one by one | *"Clean up unused resources"* |

Every tool carries **safety annotations** so your AI knows which operations are read-only and which ones need confirmation before running. No accidental `docker system prune` moments.

---

> **🆕 Recent update — v3.0:** Full **Arcane v2** support — requires **Arcane v2.8 or newer** (tested against v2.14.0). Endpoints, payloads, and tool set follow the new API — if you are still on Arcane v1.x, stay on server `2.x`. Breaking changes are listed in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Tool Filtering

Exposing all 180 tools to Claude every turn chews through your context window. Pick a **preset** to trim the active tool set — only the tools in that preset appear in `tools/list`:

| Preset | Scope | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| `commonly-used` *(recommended)* | containers, images, projects, volumes, networks | ~52 |
| `read-only` | every `*_list` / `*_get` / `*_inspect` / `*_stats` across all modules | ~60 |
| `minimal` | dashboard + container list / get / counts | 5 |
| `deploy` | projects, gitops, templates, registries, environments, build | ~40 |
| `full` *(default if never configured)* | everything | 180 |
| `custom` | your own module + per-tool picks | variable |

**Configure interactively** in Claude Code:

```
/arcane:configure
```

Walks you through picking a preset (and optional fine-tuning), shows a `+X / −Y` diff against what's currently live, and writes the selection to `~/.arcane/config.json`. The server watches that file — changes apply **live** via `notifications/tools/list_changed`, no reconnect.

**Or set it by env var:**

```bash
ARCANE_TOOL_PRESET=commonly-used
ARCANE_ENABLED_MODULES=container,image,dashboard
ARCANE_ENABLED_TOOLS=arcane_system_get_health
ARCANE_DISABLED_TOOLS=arcane_system_prune
```

Resolution order: **preset → intersect with `modules` → add `enabled` → subtract `disabled`**. Unknown names log a warning and are ignored — never silent failures, never a bricked server.

Non-Claude-Code clients can use the `arcane_configure_tools` MCP prompt for the same flow.

---

## Getting Started

The fastest way — paste this into Claude Code:

```
Fetch and follow: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RandomSynergy17/Arcane-MCP-Server/main/install_arcane_skill-mcp.md
```

It'll walk you through setup interactively. Or pick your preferred method below.

### npm Install

```bash
npm install -g @randomsynergy/arcane-mcp-server
```

### Claude Code Plugin *(recommended)*

```bash
/plugin marketplace add RandomSynergy17/Arcane-MCP-Server
/plugin install arcane-mcp-server
```

You'll be prompted for your Arcane URL and API key during setup. That's it — MCP server and companion skill installed together.

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code (manual)</strong></summary>

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio \
  --env ARCANE_API_KEY=your-key \
  --env ARCANE_BASE_URL=https://arcane.example.com:3552 \
  arcane -- npx @randomsynergy/arcane-mcp-server
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop</strong></summary>

Add to `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arcane": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@randomsynergy/arcane-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ARCANE_BASE_URL": "https://arcane.example.com:3552",
        "ARCANE_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>HTTP / Network Mode</strong></summary>

For remote or multi-client access:

```bash
ARCANE_API_KEY=your-key npx @randomsynergy/arcane-mcp-server --tcp
```

Connect at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`. Set `ARCANE_HTTP_PORT` to change the port.
</details>

### Docker

Runs the server in HTTP mode as a long-lived container. The image is built from this repo.

**Docker Compose** *(recommended)*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RandomSynergy17/Arcane-MCP-Server.git
cd Arcane-MCP-Server
cp .env.example .env        # set ARCANE_BASE_URL + ARCANE_API_KEY
docker compose up -d --build
```

- MCP endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/mcp`
- Health check: `http://localhost:3000/health`
- Change the host port with `ARCANE_MCP_PUBLISH_PORT=3100 docker compose up -d`
- Logs: `docker compose logs -f`

Then point your client at it, e.g. Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http arcane http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

> [!WARNING]
> The `/mcp` endpoint has **no authentication of its own**. Anyone who can reach it can manage your Docker hosts through Arcane. The compose file publishes the port on `127.0.0.1` only. Before exposing it to a network, put a reverse proxy with authentication (and TLS) in front of it.

**Tool filtering in Docker:** use the `ARCANE_TOOL_PRESET` / `ARCANE_*_TOOLS` env vars in `.env`. To use a config file with hot reload, uncomment the `volumes:` entry in `docker-compose.yml`. It mounts your host `~/.arcane` directory to `/home/node/.arcane` (read-only). The container runs as uid `1000`, so the file must be readable by that uid.

<details>
<summary><strong>Plain <code>docker run</code></strong></summary>

```bash
docker build -t arcane-mcp-server .

# HTTP mode (default)
docker run -d --name arcane-mcp --env-file .env \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 arcane-mcp-server

# stdio mode — for clients that spawn the server themselves
docker run -i --rm --env-file .env arcane-mcp-server --stdio
```

stdio mode in a Claude Desktop / Claude Code config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arcane": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm",
               "-e", "ARCANE_BASE_URL", "-e", "ARCANE_API_KEY",
               "arcane-mcp-server", "--stdio"],
      "env": {
        "ARCANE_BASE_URL": "https://arcane.example.com:3552",
        "ARCANE_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

> **Reaching Arcane on the same host:** inside the container, `localhost` refers to the container itself. Use the host's LAN IP or DNS name in `ARCANE_BASE_URL`. If Arcane runs in Compose on the same machine, you can also attach both to a shared network and use the service name.

<details>
<summary><strong>Config File</strong></summary>

Create `~/.arcane/config.json`:

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "https://arcane.example.com:3552",
  "auth": { "type": "apikey", "apiKey": "your-api-key" }
}
```
</details>

### Prerequisites

You need an **Arcane instance** running (see [getarcane.app](https://getarcane.app)) and an **API key** from Settings > API Keys.

---

## What Can It Do?

### Containers & Compose
Deploy, start, stop, restart, redeploy, and monitor Docker containers and Compose stacks. Inspect details, check ports, toggle auto-updates — all through conversation.

### Docker Swarm
Full cluster management. Initialize clusters, join nodes, deploy services, scale replicas, view logs, and manage the entire swarm lifecycle.

### Security & Vulnerability Scanning
Scan images for CVEs, get severity breakdowns, track which images need attention, and ignore known false positives. Environment-wide security summaries in one call.

### GitOps & Deployments
Connect Git repositories, set up automated sync, and deploy directly from branches. Supports folder-level sync and auto-deploy on push.

### Image Builds & Updates
Build images from Dockerfiles or Git URLs, check all running containers for available updates, and roll out updates with dry-run support.

### Infrastructure Management
Manage volumes (browse files, create backups, restore), networks (create, inspect topology), and registries (Docker Hub, GHCR, ECR, GCR, ACR).

### Operations Dashboard
Get a consolidated snapshot of your entire environment in one call — container counts, project status, available updates, action items that need attention.

---

## The Companion Skill

The MCP server gives Claude the *tools*. The companion skill gives it the *knowledge* — how to use those tools effectively, safely, and in the right order.

**Install with the plugin** (automatic) or **manually:**

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/RandomSynergy17/Arcane-MCP-Server.git /tmp/arcane
cp -r /tmp/arcane/skills/arcane-mcp-server ~/.claude/skills/arcane-mcp-server
rm -rf /tmp/arcane
```

### What the skill teaches Claude:

**Intent mapping** — When you say "what's broken?", Claude knows to call `arcane_dashboard_get` and drill into recent events instead of listing every container one by one.

**Safety guardrails** — Before running `arcane_volume_prune`, Claude will suggest `arcane_volume_backup_create` first. Before `arcane_updater_run`, it'll do a dry run. Before `arcane_project_destroy`, it confirms twice.

**Workflow chains** — Multi-step operations like "deploy → pull images → start → verify" are sequenced correctly, not fired off randomly.

**Gotchas** — Things like "`environmentId` is required on almost every call", "ECR credentials expire", and "always use `dryRun: true` before running the auto-updater" are baked in so you don't learn them the hard way.

---

## Built-in Workflow Prompts

The server includes five pre-built prompts that guide Claude through common multi-step operations:

| Prompt | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `/deploy-stack` | Walks through creating a project, pulling images, deploying, and verifying all services are healthy |
| `/troubleshoot-container` | Systematic diagnosis: check state, inspect config, review action items, check ports, scan for vulnerabilities |
| `/security-audit` | Full environment scan: check scanner status, get vulnerability summary, review all findings by severity, check for image updates |
| `/cleanup-environment` | Safe cleanup: survey resources, present a plan, get confirmation, then prune images, networks, and volumes in the right order |
| `arcane_configure_tools` | Walks through selecting a tool-filter preset + module / per-tool overrides and writing them to `~/.arcane/config.json` (for clients without slash commands) |

Plus four **MCP Resources** that give Claude background context:

| Resource | What it provides |
|----------|-----------------|
| `arcane://environments` | All available environments with IDs and status — so Claude can pick the right one |
| `arcane://version` | Server configuration details — base URL, default environment, protocol version |
| `arcane://tools` | JSON inventory of every tool (name, module, enabled state) — consumed by `/arcane:configure` to compute the before/after diff |
| `arcane://tools-config-notice` | Flags installs that haven't configured tool filtering yet and points them at `/arcane:configure` |

And a Claude Code slash command:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/arcane:configure` | Interactive tool-filter picker — preset, module allowlist, per-tool overrides, with a live diff before writing |

## Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ARCANE_BASE_URL` | Your Arcane instance URL | **Required** |
| `ARCANE_API_KEY` | API key for authentication | - |
| `ARCANE_USERNAME` | Username (alternative JWT auth) | - |
| `ARCANE_PASSWORD` | Password (alternative JWT auth) | - |
| `ARCANE_TIMEOUT_MS` | Request timeout in milliseconds | `30000` |
| `ARCANE_SKIP_SSL_VERIFY` | Skip SSL cert verification (self-signed certs) | `false` |
| `ARCANE_DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT_ID` | Auto-select this environment | - |
| `ARCANE_HTTP_PORT` | Port for HTTP/network mode | `3000` |
| `ARCANE_HTTP_HOST` | Host for HTTP/network mode | `localhost` |
| `ARCANE_TOOL_PRESET` | `commonly-used` / `read-only` / `minimal` / `deploy` / `full` / `custom` — see [Tool Filtering](#tool-filtering) | - |
| `ARCANE_ENABLED_MODULES` | Comma-separated module allowlist | - |
| `ARCANE_ENABLED_TOOLS` | Comma-separated tool names to force-enable | - |
| `ARCANE_DISABLED_TOOLS` | Comma-separated tool names to force-disable | - |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error` | `info` |

**Authentication:** API Key is recommended. JWT tokens are automatically refreshed before they expire.

**Tool filter:** anything set via env var overrides the corresponding field in `~/.arcane/config.json`. Unset fields fall through to the file. Change at runtime by editing `~/.arcane/config.json` — the server hot-reloads.

## Safety & Destructive Operations

Every tool includes MCP annotations that tell your AI assistant whether it's safe to run without asking. Read-only tools (list, get, browse) run freely. Destructive tools require confirmation.

| Tool | Risk | What happens |
|------|------|-------------|
| `arcane_volume_delete` | CRITICAL | Permanently deletes a volume and its data |
| `arcane_volume_prune` | CRITICAL | Removes all unused volumes |
| `arcane_project_destroy` | CRITICAL | Destroys a project, optionally including volumes |
| `arcane_system_prune` | CRITICAL | Removes all unused containers, images, networks, volumes |
| `arcane_swarm_init_cluster` | CRITICAL | Converts a standalone node to a swarm manager |
| `arcane_swarm_leave_cluster` | CRITICAL | Disconnects from the swarm cluster |
| `arcane_container_delete` | HIGH | Deletes a container |
| `arcane_network_delete` | HIGH | Deletes a network |
| `arcane_image_prune` | HIGH | Removes unused images |
| `arcane_swarm_delete_service` | HIGH | Removes a swarm service |

The companion skill adds an additional safety layer — it teaches Claude to back up before deleting, dry-run before updating, and always confirm before destroying.
